# Go Kamstrup Meter Protocl

A pure Go implementation of the Kamstrup Meter Protocol and a client for
communicating with meters based on KMP.

I created this library because I wanted a clean, robust Go library for my
district heat meter, and most/all KMP Go implementations were too hacky for
my taste. And not invented here, as I wanted to improve my Go skills.
